  huntersNotes: This colossal serpent, a relic from an era long past, commands the
    skies with a deadly grace. Its size and power harken back to a time when such
    creatures ruled the skies of Hallownest, a time even the most skilled of Hunters
    feared. It's scales, weathered but still radiant, suggest a connection to a bygone
    age of strength and ferocity
